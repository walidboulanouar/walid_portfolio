        In collaboration with a talented AI-Team, we created an innovative mobile app that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence.
        
        Our goal was to build a user-friendly interface that allows users to identify different types of waste through barcode scanning or AI-powered recognition.
        The app seamlessly integrates with a vast database containing information on millions of products available in the market.
        
        Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, our app can accurately detect and categorize various waste items, promoting effective waste management and recycling practices. 
        The combination of barcode technology and AI models enables users to make informed decisions about waste disposal and contribute to a more sustainable future. Ô∏èÔ∏è
        
        Throughout the project, I worked closely with the team to develop robust backend systems, implement efficient data processing pipelines, and create a
        visually appealing user interface.
        
        This project has not only enhanced my technical skills in mobile app development and AI integration but has also instilled in me a deep sense of purpose to contribute to environmental sustainability Ô∏è`,
